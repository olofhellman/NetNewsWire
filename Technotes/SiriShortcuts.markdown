# Siri Shortcuts on iOS

As you use NetNewsWire on iOS we donate Siri Shortcuts to the system.  These shortcuts 
can be used by Siri for shortcut prediction on the lock screen and the search screen.  They
can also be used in the Shortcuts app that is included in iOS.

For example if you visit the Starred smart, you will see a shortcut for it available in the 
Shortcuts app for you to assign a launch trigger for or to script.

#### Timeline Shortcuts

- See articles for “Today”
- See articles in “All Unread”
- See articles in “Starred”
- See articles in  “Folder” (where folder is the name of a folder you have selected)

#### Action Shortcuts

If you have a request for a shortcut you would like included in NetNewsWire,
please file it as a feature request in Github Issues.
